# OpenGraph Gen

OpenGraph.gen is a modern OG image studio that lets you design beautiful 1200×630 social preview cards without opening Figma or Photoshop.
Pick from multiple premium layouts (minimal, magazine, browser mock, code, quote, charts, and more) and fine-tune gradients, noise, grids, and typography in a live preview.
Import content directly from any URL, auto-fill title/description/site name, or write your own copy from scratch.
Upload your logo/cover image, tweak colors, add subtle texture and fade effects, and export crisp PNG/JPG/WebP in high resolution.
Host the generated image in one click (ImgBB) and instantly copy ready-to-paste SEO, Open Graph, and Twitter Card meta tags.
Perfect for developers, bloggers, SaaS founders, and marketers who want fast, consistent, on-brand social cards for every page.
